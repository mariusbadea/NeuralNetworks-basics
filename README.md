# NeuralNetworks-basics
Numpy implementation and playing ground of a neural network with a single neuron. Concepts apply unchanged for a complete neural network.

Generated data points are used for input and output instead of an existing dataset. This approach allows for a better grasp of neural network functionality. By playing with parameters - learning rate, epochs, input randomization - one can get an inside look into the neural network black-box.
